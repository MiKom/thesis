\chapter{Introduction}

%This chapter describes motivations behind the development of the thesis. It
%first briefly describes the challenges that arise with ever-increasing capacity
%of computer hardware, that enables nearly photorealistic quality in real-time graphics, but
%at the same time requires enormous amounts of artistic content like models and textures. Procedural
%generation helps to overcome this problem by the usage of parametrized
%algorithms that take limited user input and generate content usually by means
%of randomization or simulation of physical phenomena.
%
%One of such types of content, that may be desirable to generate is a karst cave.
%This geological structure may be an interesting setting for a movie scene or a
%computer game level. At the same time, it is a very complex structure
%that may be time-consuming to model by hand in a way that is both aesthetically
%pleasing and, at least partially, physically correct.

Karst formations are ubiquitous in every continent of Earth. It's estimated that
about 25\% of Earth population depends on drinking water obtained from karst
aquifers \parencite{ford2007karst}. With such profound infulence on human race,
it is essential to know how these geological structures evolve and how they may
react to human activity.

Various simulation models were developed that try to predict how karst aquifers
evolve in time, and how they react to changes in environment. These models are
implemented in computer software and represent simulated karst structure as
net of fractures.

These tools, being aimed at speleogenesis experts, present results of
calculations with simple plots. Programming project of this thesis provides
solution for richer presentation of geometric structure of modelled karst
structure. It can take input data in format that is similar to formats used by
simulation software for results and generate triangle mesh in two file formats,
of which one is simple textual file format importable by most three--dimensional
modelling software.
