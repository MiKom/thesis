\chapter{Karstification process}
This chapter will briefly describe processes that govern the development
of karts caves.

Karstification is a landscape forming process that consists of dissolution
of various kinds of bedrock. The most common kinds of solutes are limestone,
dolomite, and gypsum \parencite{karstglossary}. However, given right conditions
even some weathering-resistant rocks like quartzite may be subject to 
karstification \parencite{migon2010}\todo{Check reference}.
