\chapter{Introduction}

This chapter describes motivations behind the development of the thesis. It 
first briefly describes the challenges that arise with ever-increasing capacity 
of computer hardware, that enables nearly photorealistic quality in real-time graphics, but
at the same time requires enormous amounts of artistic content like models and textures. Procedural 
generation helps to overcome this problem by the usage of parametrized
algorithms that take limited user input and generate content usually by means
of randomization or simulation of physical phenomena.

One of such types of content, that may be desirable to generate is a karst cave.
This geological structure may be an interesting setting for a movie scene or a
computer game level. At the same time, it is a very complex structure
that may be time-consuming to model by hand in a way that is both aesthetically
pleasing and, at least partially, physically correct.
